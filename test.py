# Please NOTE that don't let the character ABILITY WASTED AND INVENTORY (iykyk)

# The Hollow Choir Zone
# A looping, underground chamber filled with white ash and memory ghosts.
# Each corner leads to different versions of the same event.
# Solving this area lets you choose which version of your past is true â€” and which parts to erase forever.
# Risk: choosing incorrectly may rewrite your character permanently.

# You enter a cracked limestone hall buried beneath an old bunker. The walls pulse faintly. Every few steps, you hear overlapping whispers â€” your voice, others' voices, out of sync.
# In this zone, time loops but slightly distorts each time. Each loop gives you access to different versions of a key memory: a betrayal, a loss, or a crime â€” but youâ€™re never sure which is real.
# ðŸ’¡ Think of it as a cross between:
# - a haunted trial chamber,
# - a looping dream where your actions change reality,
# - and a morality maze with no absolute truth.

# THIS PART WILL AFFECT THE ENDING OF THE GAME

# Alot of dialogues is coming for this scenario

#I guess tmr im just gonna finish the diaglogues for the old one first, or just planning on how the game will be operated.
