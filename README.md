### Setting:  

 | Fifty years ago, the world was obliterated by The Soundfall — a resonance event of unknown origin. It ruptured memory, time, and sound itself. Survivors emerged unable to speak. Others became Hollowed, empty shells filled only with static. 
 
 | What remains are scattered Echo Zones — warped places where memory loops and whispers invade the mind. Entering them is the only way to recover who you are — but doing so brings you closer to something else... 
 
 | Something that remembers everything.
