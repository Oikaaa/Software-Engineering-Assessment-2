This is a school project from a non experience software engineer student.
If there is bug, just leave it or fix it on your own.
This is a one time proejct so of course no changes after 100% done.

I HAVE NO MOUTH, BUT I HAVE TO SCREAM (I know there's a game already existed, but the name jsut so fire that imma take it:))) \n

Setting:  \n
 | Fifty years ago, the world was obliterated by The Soundfall — a resonance event of unknown origin. It ruptured memory, time, and sound itself. Survivors emerged unable to speak. Others became Hollowed, empty shells filled only with static. \n
 | What remains are scattered Echo Zones — warped places where memory loops and whispers invade the mind. Entering them is the only way to recover who you are — but doing so brings you closer to something else... \n
 | Something that remembers everything. \n
 Devlog: \n
